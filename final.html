                        You know how you give me words right to rap about? Here is my word: 
                        <br>
							<b> Birthday </b>			
                            <br>
						My love, it's your birthday,<br>
						May you receive love and life in every way, <br>
						May you achieve greater heights and slay,<br>
						May the sun's rays kiss your face when you wake,<br>
						May your smile never fade, nor your style or your grace, <br>
						Nor your guile, nor your grades, nor the brightness of your flame, <br>
						May you have the best of days, babe, <br>
						Never change, and turn your pain into champagne! <br>
							
                       
                    
                     </p>
                     <br>
                     <blockquote>
                        You are my sunshine, my only sunshine. 
                     </blockquote>
                     <br>
                     <p> 
                        <b> "It start like the same story here: boy meets girl, and high school sweethearts with the instant chemistry and sparks flying left and right. Because this is a story it won't be so long as to include everything that happens. Instead, it's more about how they get closer, with the Cambodia trips, the sitting next to each other in class, the secret meetups and the rants on the call. They get tighter and tighter, more stronger than ever. They're best friends, they're lovers, they're a passionate couple. The work through their differences, they make time for each other, and they try new stuff together, from the softie at cheers while filming a documentary to watching game of thrones while sneakily having sex. In the middle of all this,  they have cute moments, like how she came to visit his performance, despite her mother being angry at her, or how he scolded her when he feared that she was in danger. <br><br>



At this point, they're beyond the point of best friendship, and story shifts to London, where both of them study. They explore, go on adventures, immerse themselves in the novelty of the place, all while discovering entirely new parts within each other. Then, at one lightbulb moment, when he runs back home from a party to find her sleeping in bed, looking precious and beautiful. She wakes up drowsily and he proposes to her. And after that, things get even more beautiful, with more electric nights, and explosive days, with glorious conversations and heart-catching gestures. <br><br>



Climax of the story, where both of them admit their love to another, despite the arguments and fights that they argue over for no reason. At the end of each part, they keep on realizing the pointlessness of the bickering, because they know within that they love each other. That nothing will ever change. That they're at a place where anger and annoyance can't touch them. They're immortals in the books of love :)" </b> <br><br>

Dear Rutvi, I don’t know if you liked whatever I did for you over the last month or so, I don’t know whether you’ll remember it after some months or if you’ll cherish it after some years. All I know is, that I’ve had a wonderful time doing all of this, and more importantly, doing it for you. The only thing that I had in my mind while doing this was seeing your smile and seeing your eyes turn Chinese and your cheeks turning pinchable and your teeth turning into a Colgate advertisement. <br><br>


Dear Rutvi, here’s wishing you a very happy birthday! I want you to know that you’re pretty much my most favorite of all time in the history of ever. You got this incredible way of making me happy and I wonder if I will ever be able to repay all this to you. <i> You complete me. </i><br><br>


Dear Rutvi, I am ecstatic, and so very grateful that I have you as my best friend, my girlfriend, my soulmate, my trainer, my critic, my nurse, my partner-in-crime (the list goes on for quite some time). I couldn’t have asked for more from life. You are my home. I need to tell you that if ever I push you away, I don’t really mean it. We are going to talk it out. We will work out.  Always.  I love our chemistry. I love our equation. How amazing it is to find someone who wants to hear about all the things that go on in their lives. You and I, are a risk worth taking. We have a future that is brighter than the Sun and the stars. I can't wait to face it with you, together. We are lovebirds and we're soaring, flying, there's not a star in heaven that we can't reach :) <br><br>

Dear Rutvi, sometimes we lie down side by side and I wrap my arm around your waist, or when we cuddle, and I can feel the warmth of your skin, I can’t help but think how lucky I am. You chose me of all people. You’re wonderful. And way out of my league. It's like winning the lottery that you chose me. I thank the heavens. Shout out to the lords and the gods, that you picked me. Every moment with you is bliss. The way we cook together, the way we dance together, the way we make love together. It's phenomenal. <br>
<br>
 
Dear Rutvi, I hope you realize your importance not only to me, but to everyone who has been lucky enough to know you. I hope you know that whenever you feel down, I will be there and I will strive for your smile. I hope you remember I am going to be there for you no matter what. You are a living, walking, breathing goddess and you have showered happiness and life on so many people. You have helped your family become stronger than ever, you have helped those who take care of you with their lives make informed choices (like your wonderful Hetal didi!), you have even helped those who you don't know live better lives! You have taught them, showed them their true potential, and helped their find their wings! <br>
<br>

Dear Rutvi, I fully intend on staying in your life for quite some time. I appreciate and adore you without restraints, and this friendship and the bond will never change. If anything, it will get stronger, and more unique. We are a duo to be reckoned with! <br>
<br>

Dear Rutvi, be the amazing person that you are. Always and forever. Dear Rutvi, my love, my jaan, my cutie, my shonamona, my sweetie, my jaaneman, my angel, my princess, my queen, my pineapple, my cheeku, the mother of Yoi, happy birthday <3
