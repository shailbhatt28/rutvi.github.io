                     <h1>All of your questions, answered.</h1>
                    <p> <strong> If you could fix one world problem, what would it be? </strong> Right now, I think the biggest problem isn't world peace or disease, but rather overpopulation and the pressure on resources, so I would want to get that under control, ideally by promoting contraceptions or go full Inferno lol <br>
                       <br>
                       <strong> If you could live in any era, which would it be and why? </strong> Either Renaissance because of the outburst of cool new art and science, or during the 1990s to 2000s because what an era for hip-hop :O Watching the rise of Wutang, Outkast, DOOM, Jay-Z, chhotu Lil Wayne heeheehee <br>
                       <br>
                       <strong> What advice would you give to a person who is just graduating high school? </strong> Keep your head up, stay ahead of the curve, and keep on trying new things! <br>
                       <br>
                       <strong> If you could have chosen your own name, what would you have picked? </strong> You know I love Shail, so no change. NOPE. <br>
                       <br>
                       <strong> If your home was on fire and you only had time to grab 3 things, what would they be? </strong> 1) My phone, because contacts and calling everyone up to get a place to stay, 2) underwear, because fire will destroy clothes and you don't want to wear dirty underwear all the time, and 3) my wallet because how else will I get food? #technicalshailistechnical <br>

                     <p> <br>
                       <strong> If you became famous, would you enjoy the limelight or miss your privacy? </strong> Definitely privacy. I mean I would love the fame and all, but I always imagine how celebrities would continue with their daily lives. Like how would Kendrick Lamar walk into Sainsbury's if he could? <br>
                       <br>
                       <strong> If you had $200 to spend on something special just for me, what would you buy? </strong> I would by you the easel that you've always wanted, and along with that I would buy you some more black dresses and t-shirts xD But at the same time I would also consider buying tickets to Rome and booking a room for the night and I think 200 pounds would be like ideal. <br>
                       <br>
                       <strong> If you had three wishes, what would they be? </strong> I would wish for the world to be self-sustaining and its people understanding of its condition, would wish for prosperity for me, my friends, and my family, and lastly I would wish for the ability to create things by just imagining them. <br>
                       <br>
                       <strong> If you were told you have a terminal illness, how would you take the news? </strong> Well given the fact that I've been interning with oncology fo the last few days, I would laugh at the irony. <br>
                       <br>
                       <strong> If you only had a week left to live, what are some things you would do? </strong> I would steal from the supermarkets! I would fuck you like there's no tomorrow! I would eat till I would explode and I would speed on the highway! I would say thank you to all the people that matter to me and call them up and tell them I appreciate them. <br> </p>
                       <br>

                       <p> <br>
                       <strong> Would you sacrifice yourself for a stranger? </strong> Nah, unless I knew that they would do better things than me or if they had a more burning potential, then yes. <br>
                       <br>
                       <strong> If a family member needed a kidney and you were the only match, would you give one up? </strong> Of course! Without hesitating. <br>
                       <br>
                       <strong> If I wanted a puppy for my birthday, would you adopt a purebred from a breeder or a mix from a shelter? </strong> I think you would prefer a mix from the shelter because you care about society and helping those in need. Dogs are no different! <br>
                       <br>
                       <strong> You suspect that your neighbors may be abusing their child, do you mind your own business or call the police? </strong> See if it stops, and if it doesn't then definitely call the police. <br>
                       <br>
                       <strong> If I went missing, my body never recovered, would you move on or devote your life to looking for me? If you did move on, how long would you wait? </strong> Of course I would continue looking for you. If you went missing this very instant, I wouldn't stop until I went to all police stations in Ahmedabad and London, called up your kakas, and family in Dahod, Baaria, Mumbai, and find a hacker who can get me CCTV footage and finally find you having escaped to Disneyland xD <br> </p>

                       <p> <br>
                       <strong> If you could invite 3 people from history to dinner, who would they be? </strong> J Dilla, Tupac, and Jimi Hendrix and jam with them would be an interesitng combination :P <br>
                       <br>
                       <strong> If you could live til you were 90 and either have the mind or body of a 30-yr-old, which would you choose and why? </strong> Body of a 30 year old, because unless I get a neurodegenerative disease I'm going to be Betty White xD <br>
                       <br>
                       <strong> If you could wake up tomorrow and have gained one ability, what would it be and why? </strong> The ability to control time, space, and matter so I would like legit God xD <br>
                       <br>
                       <strong> If you could live anywhere, where would you live? </strong> Basel, Switzerland is my current dream city, but I wish I could fuse London and Ahmedabad together by this space tube that you could travel back and forth and that would be my favourite. <br>
                       <br>
                       <strong> Which one fits you better? "Live for the moment", or "Save the best for last"? </strong> With food, it's usually save the best for last, but in person with people or with you, I live for the moment. <br> </p>
                       <br>

                     <p>  <br>
                       <strong> What's your favorite thing about yourself? </strong> That once I commit to something, I try to achieve that goal no matter what. <br>
                       <br>
                       <strong> If you could change anything about yourself, what would it be? </strong> To commit to more things. <br>
                       <br>
                       <strong> Do you prefer going out or staying in? </strong> Depends on my mood but usually I'm a stay-in person. But I like going out to parks and walks, and fun places. <br>
                       <br>
                       <strong> Would you consider yourself an externally motivated or internally motivated person? </strong> Internally motivated at first, but the external circumstances push me to better that internal motivation. <br>
                       <br>
                       <strong> How do you deal with failure? </strong> By working my ass off to make sure it doesn't happen again and that I hit the next one out of the park. <br> </p>
                       <br>

                     <p>  <br>
                       <strong> Do you put more attention to the people around you or the things around you? </strong> Increasingly, yes I have been paying attention. It's a good thing, because before I was completely oblivious. <br>
                       <br>
                       <strong> When things break, do you prefer to fix them or replace them? </strong> Try and fix them first, and the replace if it doesn't work. <br>
                       <br>
                       <strong> Would you consider yourself materialistic? </strong> Not at all. <br>
                       <br>
                       <strong> What would you consider a perfect day? </strong> A productive day where I do a lot of things that contribute to my future, you know? With good lunches and great conversations, stimulating workload, and refreshing breaks. Somewhere where mind, body, spirit are all flexed. <br>
                       <br>
                       <strong> What would be your perfect date night? </strong> I think we've already had it. Pizza at home, watching a movie, with a chilled Coke, and then going out for a walk after. With light music, fun board games. What more do I need to ask for? <br> </p>

                       <br>
                       <strong> What is one thing that you cannot start your day without? </strong> Milk. And also a plan on a post-it or journal! <br>
                       <br>
                       <strong> If you’re stressed out, what helps you wind down? </strong> Either working out, playing bongos, listening HEAVY BASS rap, or just writing things down.
                    <br>
                      <strong>When you die, do you want to be buried or cremated? Why? </strong>I want to be cremated, and then be really filmy and cheesy and have them scattered in the 7 different wonders of the world and everything :O </p>

<p>
                      <strong> What inspires you? </strong>I guess anything and everything can be an inspiration. When studying, I think that the hunger to be the best is what inspires me to do more. When I'm with you, the joy of making you smile is what inspires me to be a good boyfriend. </p>
                    <p><br>
                      <strong> Would you consider yourself an optimist, pessimist, or realist? </strong>I would consider myself a positive realist. Realist because I see things the way they are and try to act rationally on them, but positive because the way I act and the outcome I expect is very optimistic (and ofter naive). </p>
                    <p><br>
                      <strong> We notice an old man living out of a shopping cart behind a grocery store. What is your first thought about him? </strong>My first thought would be sadness. I think I've told you this but when I was young I was like Salman Khan in HSSH, and I used to hate poverty, and used to be extremely saddenned by it. Seeing that man would make me really unhappy, and make me sympathize with him</p>
                    <p><strong><br>
                      Someone calls me something horrible. Do you let me fight my own battles, or jump in and defend me? </strong>I jump in and defend you, though I know you're perfectly capable of fighting them yourself, but I gotta let that someone know that if they mess with you, they mess with me. And that I can't abide by. </p>
                    <p><br>
                      <strong> Do you think it's okay to have a close female friend at work?</strong> Seeing that most of my close friends are girls, I don't think that it's a problem, and I know how to keep my distance and keep things professional. </p>

                      <strong> What's something that no one else knows about you? </strong>I think you know everything about me. I don't think people know about how I was bullied, how I really feel about friendship and how much it really means to me. </p>
                    <p><strong><br>
                      Do you ever rehearse a phone call beforehand? </strong>Hahahahaha even with Dominos I do this, so that I don't fuck up the order or something :P </p>
                    <p><br>
                      <strong> When did you last sing to yourself? To someone else?</strong> I last sang to myself at 23:42 on 07/08/2018, as I am writing this "One kiss is all it takes, to fall in love with me" by Dua Lipa :P And I last sang to you! It was a song I randomly made up, about asking you to forgive me. </p>
                    <p><br>
                      <strong> What are you most thankful for? </strong>For being born into a world with less difficulties and obstacles than others. Not being born in poverty, and not facing health issues is something that I am the most grateful. But I'm grateful for the opportunities given to me, like going to Holland, going to Chennai, meeting you, meeting friends, all that amazing stuff. </p>
                    <p><strong><br>
                      What do you most fear about getting older? </strong>Sickness! Lol diabetes and blood pressure run in the family. Now Alzheimer's. Fuck me. </p>

                      <strong> Have you ever done something you regretted? </strong>This is me half the time. </p>
                    <p><br>
                      <strong> Where do you see yourself in five years? </strong>Probably somewhere in Europe, hopefully Switzerland. Done with my Masters, working at a kickass job earning lots of money, driving my sexy BMW car. Driving that sexy BMW car to <em>OUR </em>home where we live in a sexy house with sexy furniture with a pool table and a jacuzzi! No but realistically, in Europe, living in an apartment, earning a very decent income, still heads over heels in love for you, continuing bongos and music, working with oncology or immunology and helping in making the world a better place!</p>
                    <p><br>
                      <strong> What is your happiest memory? </strong>This is a very difficult question to answer, but there are plenty of moments: When I found out I topped Biology in India or when I topped IB, or when I got into UCL, or when I finally rode a rollercoaster for the first time, or when after years of talking about kettuvalams, I finally stayed in one, or when I asked you out after Dhamaal ended, or when TJ and you made me that wonderful video for my birthday! </p>
                    <p><br>
                      <strong> When was the last time you shed a tear? </strong>I am actually crying a little as I write this. We are currently fighting about something (I don't want to spoil the mood by talking about it), and it's just making me feel so frustrated with myself. I'm sorry, Rutvi. </p>
                    <p><br>
                      <strong> What is a tradition you did as a child that you want to do with your kids someday? </strong>Watching Pancham Unmixed, or ordering Dominos on mom's birthday and chilling with a movie or with enchiladas! <br>

                      <strong> What are some things in life that you had to learn the hard way? </strong>That you have got to look twice before crossing the road, that you shouldn't blindly trust someone (because they can be real dicks and desert you), that you should be self-sufficient and not rely too much on others, and that you should always hope for the best but plan for the worst. </p>
                    <p><br>
                      <strong> Do you have any dreams from childhood that you can vividly recall? </strong>I remember falling off a cliff like Wiley Cayote and when I looked around I saw golden limosines with golden Arabs in them. It was in the middle of a sandstorm but it was quite cool nonetheless. </p>
                    <p>&nbsp;<br>
                      <strong> What were your childhood aspirations, and how have they changed? </strong>I wanted to be a driver, like Michael Schumacher but I can't even reverse properly yet :P I also wanted to be a game developer for Lego with Bionicles and Hero Factory and I still adore Lego and am devastatingly good with them, but I don't wanna do that any more...duh!</p>
                    <p><br>
                      <strong> How do you picture your life when you're 60? </strong>I don't know, I want to be a cool professor or on the panel for WHO. But more casual and consultant type. Spending more time with my grandkids and going on funky vacation spots! Playing tennis with my pals, and still cooking new dishes. Treating my offspring everytime to epic food or hell, making it myself! </p>
                    <p><br>
                      <strong> What is your most terrible memory? </strong>When I was at Spandanbhai's wedding, I was really sick. And during the reception, I farted but it wasn't a fart, it was something much much worse...</p>

<p>
                      <strong> How have you changed the most since you were younger? </strong>Academically, I have stayed the same hungry and persistent self. Physically, I have changed a lot. I didn't care about my physique before, but now I totally do. I am also more gregarious now, and before I ran with a really small clique.
                    <br><br>

                      <strong>In what areas do you want to change the most? </strong>I want to be more adventurous and be more bold with my actions. I want to become much healthier and much more active with my social life.
                    <br><br>

                      <strong> When was the first time you were in love? </strong>When I truly meant it for real? Around March 2018 with a special someone named Rutvi Sheth.But the first time it was puppy love like gulugulu it was like around 2013 xD
<br>
                    <br>
                      <strong> When was the first time you said I love you?</strong>&nbsp;When I actually meant it in a non-puppy love way? April 2018 to my princess :) Otherwise lol #puppylove2k13.
<br>
                    <br>
                      <strong> Is there any book that changed your life? </strong>There generally isn't any book that changed my life. But I think that reading particular types of books like The Other Side of Midnight by Sidney Sheldon or Kill Me if You Can by James Patterson took me to the other side with hardcore gripping thrillers
                    <br>
                    <br>

                      <strong> What is your biggest insecurity? </strong>I guess my body? It's very weird shaped and I hate it being pointed out. Part of why Cambodia was so cringe with the lads. But also the fact that maybe I am not actually smart and I'm just floating along, and when I'm with professionals and I can't keep up I get major complex.
<br>
                    <br>
                      <strong> If you could change anything about the past, what would it be? </strong>So many things. I wish I had gone on every ride in Disneyland. I wish I had said goodbye to my friends before I left Holland forever. I wish I had punched Francis back when he hit me in the stomach. I wish I hadn't hurt you ever.
<br>
                    <br>
                      <strong> Why do you think the divorce rate is so high nowadays? </strong>Shitty communication these days man. Lack of an effort to solve problems. "Text message break-ups, the casualty of tour" is what Kanye raps in Devil in a New Dress and he's right. We don't confront anymore.
<br>
                    <br>
                      <strong> If you were running for president, what are three key things you would include in your campaign? </strong>I'm assuming this is India and it's PM not President, but I would call for better sanitation, education, and healthcare systems. Infrastructure I hope Modi takes care of it. But the maintenance and usability of infrastructure is included in my sanitation. Healthcare systems would include regulation of drug and alcohol use too!
<br>
                    <br>
                      <strong> Are you pro-choice or pro-life? </strong>Pro-choice. DON'T HAVE BABIES IF YOU DON'T WANT THEM JESUS. More babies, more resources used. Don't want that. Especially if the parents don't care.
<br>
                    <br>
                      <strong> How do you feel about genetically modified food? </strong>Amen to GMOs. That way Yashvini the vegan will also be pleased because grow meat in bulk! It's a win-win!
<br>
                    <br>
                      <strong> What is one thing that you feel would make any small business owner more successful? </strong>I guess the word of mouth. The more his product reaches the masses, the more the people want it. And the more they want it, the more he would make and more he would need to make so he would expand and get bigger! (Correct me if I'm wrong)
<br>
                    <br>
                      <strong> What invention do you think has done the most for the human race? </strong>Internet has made the world smaller than anything xD
<br>
                    <br>
                      <strong> Should children be allowed to have cell phones? </strong>I fucking hate little kids who can't eat unless they have a video playing like that's addiction right there. So no. Unless they're responsible, only then.
<br>
                    <br>
                      <strong> Do you think a person’s outward appearance says anything about who they are as a person? </strong>That's what leaves the first impression, so I guess it does. But it doesn't say EVERYTHING! And you have to know the person more to find out how big the iceberg really is!
<br>
                    <br>
                      <strong> How important do you think it is to do well in school? </strong>In the grand scheme of things, quite important but not as important as you would think. I think doing well has given me an amazing launchpad and credibility, but I'm sure a lot of people get there without doing the same. But it's a great confidence boost.
<br>
                    <br>
                      <strong> Would you consider yourself proud to live in this country? </strong>India? Of course. Proud of all that we do and advance in technology and in sports and everything. But often I am not. With the way crime spreads in this country and the lack of regulation of certain things, there are plenty of things to change. But I am confident that we'll be able to get to greater heights as time progresses!
<br>
                    <br>
                      <strong> Is there anything too serious to be joked about? </strong>Not really, but there is always a given TIME for things. Making death jokes after someone close passes away may not be funny ,but in time, it would be possible and darkly heehee!
<br>
                    <br>
                      <strong> What are your views on the political system? </strong>Apparently I'm central leftist lol. </p>
